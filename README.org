* Acme Inventory
Chose to use webpack. You will find front end items in clientSrc which will build into the public folder. 

Requires pg database called 'products'. Running seed.js in database folder will populate a minimal amount of items in 'products'.

Chose not to use and hashrouter stuff. Everything is displayed as SPA, no hashchanges needed to make this work in this case. I may choose to provide an add form. Provided I have enough time before Tuesday class on June 25.
